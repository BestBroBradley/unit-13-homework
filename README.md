Hamburger Helper

# OVERVIEW

This is a simple app that highlights the CRUD ability of server/client communication.  A user can add a new item to the database and then later update that item.  The program also uses boolean values to determine where eat database item should appear on the page.  The dynamic HTML elements were created using Handlebar templating.
